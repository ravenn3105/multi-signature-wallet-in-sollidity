# Multi-Signature Wallet Smart Contract

This smart contract is designed to implement a multi-signature wallet on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows three owners to propose and approve transactions. To ensure security and correctness, several checks and safeguards have been implemented.

## Features

1. **Three Owners**: The contract is configured to have three owners, each identified by their Ethereum addresses.

2. **Transaction Proposals**: Owners can propose transactions by providing the destination address and amount.

3. **Transaction Approval**: Once a transaction is proposed, owners can approve it.

4. **Execution of Transactions**: If at least two owners approve a transaction, it is executed, transferring the specified amount to the destination address.

5. **Transaction Identifier**: Each transaction is assigned a unique identifier using a simple incrementing counter.

6. **Security Measures**: The contract includes necessary checks to ensure correct and secure operation.

## Usage

1. **Deploy the Contract**: Deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain, specifying the three owner addresses.

2. **Propose Transactions**: Owners can propose transactions by calling the `proposeTransaction` function, providing the destination address and amount.

3. **Approve Transactions**: Owners can approve proposed transactions by calling the `approveTransaction` function with the transaction identifier.

4. **Execute Transactions**: If at least two owners approve a transaction, it is automatically executed, transferring the specified amount to the destination address.

## Smart Contract Details

- The smart contract is written in Solidity, a programming language for Ethereum smart contracts.
- The contract is designed to be secure and efficient, preventing common pitfalls such as duplicate owners, invalid addresses, and multiple approvals for the same transaction.

## Deployment

1. Compile the Solidity code using a suitable compiler.
2. Deploy the compiled contract to the Ethereum blockchain, specifying the three owner addresses.

## Development and Testing

- The contract can be further customized or extended based on specific requirements.
- Use appropriate tools and frameworks for testing the contract, such as Truffle or Remix.
